# Problem overview
problem: "The client is undergoing a DevSecOps adoption process for the
implementation of Cloud Native developments to improve their services as well as
synergy with their providers. Despite these positive efforts, they also face
challenges related to the observability of their IT services. The lack of a
clear and comprehensive view of the health status of their service
infrastructure hinders the proactive identification of operational issues as
well as the detection of their origin once they occur. This aspect affects the
stability and quality of service and the confidence of the different
stakeholders, underscoring the importance of addressing concerns around
observability to ensure a successful and smooth implementation."
# Solution overview
solution: "A comprehensive solution was implemented to address the challenges
identified in the Bank's infrastructure. The adoption of advanced practices,
such as infrastructure as code on AWS with Kubernetes, ensures compliance with
the rigorous standards of the BCRA and establishes a solid foundation for agile
development of cloud-native services. In addition to introducing continuous
deployment and integration (CI/CD) workflows to streamline the development
lifecycle, a comprehensive observability project was carried out, customizing
dashboards and employing advanced tools for tracing, logs, and metrics. This
comprehensive approach not only provided effective and detailed control of IT
services but also anticipated issues and improved operational efficiency,
resulting in superior user service with lower operational costs."
