      content : "Initiated in network and server administration in the National University of La Plata, in Argentina, we quickly fell in love with solving problems through quality, elegant, effective and efficient solutions. In addition, our time in College instilled in us another passion: teaching.\n\nDuring the following years, we worked in IT support and infrastructure, and in software development, in addition to collaborating with multiple organizations, both private and public. We believe that all this experience has given us a broad perspective on the reality of the industry and its players.\n\nHaving experienced firsthand many of the problems organizations face, we understood that the solutions that worked for us could help others. That's how Mikroways was born, with the aim of providing solutions for organizations so that they can overcome the technological barriers that limit or prevent their growth and progress."
